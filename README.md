### ⚡ Quick Inject (Recommended)
Paste this into your console for the fastest setup. It always loads the latest version:

fetch('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BoringYak46030/Blooket-gui-hacks/refs/heads/main/Index.js')
  .then(res => res.text())
  .then(code => {
    eval(code);
    console.log("%c BoringYak Loaded: v30.0 ", "color: #8ab4f8; background: #202124; font-weight: bold;");
  });
